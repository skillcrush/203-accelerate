Drag and drop fields in an intuitive UI to create contact forms, email subscription forms, order forms, payment forms, send emails and more!

== Description ==
Ninja Forms is the ultimate FREE form creation tool for WordPress. Build forms within minutes using a simple yet powerful drag-and-drop form creator. For beginners, quickly and easily design complex forms with absolutely no code. For developers, utilize built-in hooks, filters, and even custom field templates to do whatever you need at any step in the form building or submission using Ninja Forms as a framework.

**Features of Ninja Forms include, but are not limited to:**

* A gorgeous and intuitive user interface.
* NO LIMITATIONS on the number of forms, fields, emails, actions, or submissions.
* Dedicated, easy to use fields for emails, dates (w/ datepicker), phone numbers, addresses and more
* Modify your own field then save them as favorites to re-use later (even in other forms!)
* Force required fields and correct data formatting with custom input masks
* Give your users a success message or redirect them elsewhere after they complete a form.
* Manage, Edit, and Export form user submissions.
* Export and Import forms and favorite fields.
* Email form data to administrators and/or users every time a form is processed.
* Customize emails and add raw HTML(for photos, videos, and more) with the powerful Summernote HTML editor.
* Several anti-spam options including Google reCaptcha, question/response fields, and honeypot fields
* Form submission via AJAX, allowing a seamless user experience without page refreshes
* Please note that if you are using a version of PHP lower than 5.3, you may experience some problems using AJAX Submissions. These can be minimized by using simple success/error messages without any quotes or special characters.

= Ninja Forms also has a complete library of add-ons to take your forms to new heights: =

**Increase form conversions**

[Breaking forms into smaller parts](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/mult-part-forms/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=Multi-Part+Forms) or [allowing users to save and return](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/save-progress/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=Save+Progress) make longer forms less intimidating. [Conditional Logic](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/conditional-logic/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=Conditional+Logic) will allow you to show field only to users who need them and send emails or process actions only under specific conditions.

Beautiful forms convert better than crowded unorganized forms. While Ninja Forms looks great on any well styled theme and is easy to style further if your are comforatble with CSS, [Layout and Styles](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/layout-styles/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=Layout+and+Styles) makes it easy to create columns for your forms as well as style specific elements.

**Collect payments**

Ninja Forms gives you the ability to collect payments through [PayPal Express](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/paypal-express/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=PayPal+Express), [Stripe](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/stripe/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=Stripe), or [Elavon](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/elavon/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=Elavon). More payment gateways coming.

**All the best customer relationship management integrations**

When someone fills out your form the most natural thing to do is send their data directly to your favorite CRM. Ninja Forms makes this easy with plenty of CRM integrations such as [SalesForce](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/salesforce-crm/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=SalesForce+CRM), [Batchbook](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/batchbook-crm/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=Batchbook+CRM), [Zoho](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/zoho-crm/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=Zoho+CRM), [Insightly](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/insightly-crm/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=Insightly+CRM), [Capsule](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/capsule-crm/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=Capsule+CRM), etc.
